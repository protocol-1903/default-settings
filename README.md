Allows you to save alternate default setting states for the circuit and entity settings. Useable per type (belt, inserter, assembling machine, etc) or individually (express transport belt, stack inserter, assembling machine 1, etc)

Support for each entity has to be programmed manually. I'll get around to finishing them eventually, but if you'd like me to expedite the process on specific ones let me know!

Currently supported:
- display panel
- furnace
- inserter
- programmable speaker
- pump
- transport belt

Not yet supported:
- accumulator
- agricultural tower
- ammo turret
- artillery turret
- assembling machine
- asteroid collector
- burner generator
- electric turret
- fluid turret
- fusion generator
- fusion reactor
- generator
- lamp
- splitter (and lane splitter)
- loader (and loader 1x1)
- logistic container
- mining drill
- offshore pump
- power switch
- radar
- reactor
- roboport
- rocket silo
- storage tank
- train stop
- turret
- wall

No support intended, for one reason or another:
- heat interface
- infinity container
- infinity pipe

TODO:
- undo/redo support (yayyyy....)

Might do eventually (more likely if requested):
- Mod support: allow 'alt' versions of the same entity to use the same settings, for when a mod uses scripts to replace virtually the same entity
- Manager GUI to show the current settings, and allowing you to change them.

If you have a mod idea, let me know and I can look into it.
